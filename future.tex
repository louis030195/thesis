\chapter{Future Work}
\section{Individual species identification}
It could be as much interesting as useful to be able to differentiate a species from another, it could be used to track and understand some behaviours.
In order to implement such a thing a similar approach than face recognition algorithm could be used, previous work has been done on bear\cite{bearfacenet}, indeed facenet\cite{facenetoriginal} algorithm is adapted to this kind of task.

\section{New tasks}

In the solution we propose, only object detection is handled, in the future some more tasks could be setup, putting multiple models at disposal to the user.

\subsection{Video classification}
Video classification(action classification) in the field of wild life could be used to understand the behaviours of different species over time and space, while it's probably inaccessible now due to the lacks of data and being a less popular task, it can still be solved later by means of creating datasets specially designed and annotated for this.

\subsection{Pose estimation}
Pose estimation is the task to track an animal's every part of the body small movement in real time.
Of similar utility than video classification, it could help to understand species behaviour and interactions.
Again, this task imply the creation of datasets designed and annotated for this task.
