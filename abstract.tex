\chapter{Abstract}
In this work I present an easy to deploy, maintain, scale and price cloud solution for wildlife monitoring powered by artificial intelligence, which makes it possible to conduct an extensive data collection and analysis and to quickly deploy and track new monitoring data for any particular group of species and in any habitat. In particular, I show how this software can scale from an initial few images to up to tens of thousands of videos per month.

I believe that monitoring of the status of our planet's animals using a wide variety of technology and platforms is crucial to improve biodiversity conservation and to develop novel methods of managing species. I demonstrate how to implement a cloud application for cloud based monitoring of wildlife using artificial intelligence (AI). This solution also offer ways to analyze the data for the monitoring of species and the ability to aggregate data to identify patterns and trends to inform ecologists.

Most importantly, for animal identification, our system can save a tremendous amount of time of the manual labor while performing at the same accuracy level than human volunteers.
